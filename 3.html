    <p>In western countries, the most common motive for people
      to consider turning vegetarian has to do with health consciousness.<br>
      Studies on the health effects of vegetarian diets observe mixed effects on mortality.<br>
      One review found a decreased overall risk of all cause mortality, cancer (except breast)
      and cardiovascular disease;<br> however, a meta-analysis found lower risk for ischemic
       heart disease and cancer but no effect on overall mortality or cerebrovascular disease.<br>
       Possible limitations include varying definitions used of vegetarianism,
       and the observation of increased risk of lung cancer mortality in those on a vegetarian diet
        for less than five years.<br> An analysis pooling two large studies found vegetarians
        in the UK have similar all cause mortality as meat eaters.</p>
